# 🌐 GlobalSend DevOps Pipeline  
**Automated Multi-Environment Deployment | Terraform, Azure App Service, GitHub Actions**

---

## 🚀 Overview
GlobalSend is a money transfer web application deployed across multiple Azure environments using **Terraform** and **GitHub Actions**. The pipeline implements a **Blue-Green deployment strategy** for zero-downtime production releases.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Predictable, secure, and scalable multi-environment deployment  
- Developer-first automation via **PowerShell + GitHub Actions**  
- Terraform Infrastructure as Code for reproducible environments  
- Zero-downtime releases with Blue-Green production deployment
